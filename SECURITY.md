# Security Policy

## Overview

This project provides infrastructure automation for HomeLab environments. Security practices are designed for self-hosted, private network deployments.

## Security Practices

### Authentication & Access Control

- **SSH Keys**: All remote access uses SSH key authentication
- **Service Accounts**: Dedicated accounts for automation services
- **Credential Management**: Environment variables and secure credential stores
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for each service

### Certificate Management

- **Internal CA**: Self-signed Certificate Authority for internal SSL/TLS
- **Automated Rotation**: Scheduled certificate renewal and deployment
- **Secure Storage**: Private keys protected with appropriate file permissions
- **Transport Security**: HTTPS/TLS for all web interfaces

### Infrastructure Security

- **HashiCorp Vault**: Encrypted secret storage with raft consensus
- **Network Segmentation**: Internal networks isolated from public access
- **Automated Patching**: Regular security updates via Jenkins automation
- **Container Security**: Docker containers with resource limits and security contexts

### Monitoring & Auditing

- **System Monitoring**: Prometheus exporters for security-relevant metrics
- **Log Management**: Centralized logging for security events
- **Change Tracking**: Git-based infrastructure as code with audit trails

## Supported Versions

| Component | Version | Security Updates |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Ansible Playbooks | Latest | ✅ Active |
| Docker Images | Latest tags | ✅ Active |
| Vault | Current stable | ✅ Active |
| Monitoring Stack | Current stable | ✅ Active |

## Risk Assessment

### Threat Model

- **Target Environment**: Private HomeLab networks (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x)
- **Primary Users**: Individual operators and family members
- **Attack Vectors**: Network intrusion, credential compromise, supply chain
- **Risk Level**: Medium (private infrastructure, non-production)

### Known Limitations

- **Development Focus**: Optimized for learning and experimentation
- **Self-Signed Certificates**: Not suitable for public-facing services
- **Default Configurations**: May require hardening for high-security environments
- **Credential Management**: Relies on environment variables and local storage

## Reporting Security Issues

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. **Email**: Contact maintainers directly via GitHub
3. **Include**: Detailed description, reproduction steps, potential impact
4. **Timeline**: Allow reasonable time for assessment and fixes

### What to Report

- Authentication bypasses or privilege escalation
- Credential exposure or insecure storage
- Network security misconfigurations
- Container escape or privilege issues
- Secrets management vulnerabilities

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 72 hours
2. **Assessment**: Security impact evaluation
3. **Remediation**: Fix development and testing
4. **Disclosure**: Public disclosure after fix is available
5. **Recognition**: Security researcher credit (if desired)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Pre-Deployment

- **Review Configurations**: Audit all variables and templates
- **Network Security**: Ensure proper firewall and network segmentation
- **Credential Generation**: Use strong, unique passwords and keys
- **Environment Isolation**: Deploy in isolated test environment first

### Operational Security

- **Regular Updates**: Apply security patches promptly
- **Monitoring**: Review monitoring alerts and logs regularly
- **Backup Security**: Encrypt and secure backup storage
- **Access Reviews**: Regularly audit user access and permissions

### Incident Response

- **Isolation**: Immediate containment of compromised systems
- **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact of security incidents
- **Recovery**: Restore from known-good backups and configurations
- **Documentation**: Record lessons learned for future prevention

## Compliance Considerations

### Standards Alignment

While not formally compliant, this project incorporates practices from:
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- **CIS Controls**: Basic security hygiene and configuration management
- **OWASP**: Secure development and deployment practices

### Audit Capabilities

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete audit trail via Git history
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible playbook execution logs
- **Certificate Tracking**: CA-signed certificate inventory and rotation
- **Access Logging**: SSH and service authentication logs
